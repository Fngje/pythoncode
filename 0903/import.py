# python之禅
'''
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
翻译成中文就是：

美丽比丑陋好
显性优于隐性。
简单比复杂好。
复杂比复杂更好。
平好比嵌套。
稀疏比密集好。
可读性计数。
特殊情况不足以破坏规则。
虽然实用性是纯粹的。
错误不应该默默地传递。
除非明确地沉默
面对歧义，拒绝猜测的诱惑。
应该有一个 - 最好只有一个 - 显而易见的办法。
尽管如此，除非您是荷兰人，否则首先可能不明显。
现在比以往更好
虽然从来没有比现在更好*。
如果实施难以解释，这是一个坏主意。
如果实现很容易解释，可能是个好主意。
命名空间是一个很好的主意 - 让我们做更多的这些！
